# OPD Token Allocation Engine

## Overview

This project implements a backend **OPD (Outpatient Department) token allocation engine** for a hospital. The system manages doctor schedules, allocates patient tokens across fixed time slots, enforces priority rules, and dynamically reallocates slots on cancellations and emergencies.

The solution is intentionally kept **simple, deterministic, and explainable**, while still modeling realistic hospital workflows.

---

## Problem Understanding

Hospitals face challenges in OPD scheduling due to:

- Fixed doctor availability
- Limited consultation capacity per hour
- Multiple patient entry sources with different priorities
- Emergency patients who must be accommodated immediately
- Cancellations and no-shows that should not waste capacity

### Goals

The goal is to design a system that:

- ✅ Allocates OPD tokens fairly and predictably
- ✅ Honors medical and business priorities
- ✅ Adapts dynamically during the day

---

## System Design Overview

### Core Entities

#### 1. Doctor
- Owns multiple fixed hourly time slots

#### 2. TimeSlot
- Represents a 1-hour window
- Has a hard maximum capacity
- Maintains confirmed and waitlisted tokens

#### 3. Token
- Represents a patient visit
- Has a source, priority, status, and timestamp

### Storage Model

**Fully in-memory**

Central store maintains:
- Doctors
- Tokens
- Priority mapping

This design keeps the logic easy to reason about and easy to migrate later to Redis or a database.

---

## Token Prioritization Logic

### Priority Order (Highest → Lowest)

1. **Emergency**
2. **Paid**
3. **Follow-up**
4. **Online**
5. **Walk-in**

> **Note:** Lower numeric value = higher priority.

### Allocation Rules

- If a slot has capacity, the token is **confirmed**.
- If a slot is full:
  - A higher-priority token can **displace** the lowest-priority confirmed token.
  - Displaced tokens move to the **waitlist**.
- **Emergency tokens:**
  - Ignore normal capacity
  - Are always confirmed (with controlled overbooking)

---

## API Endpoints

### 1. Create Doctor and Slots

**`POST /doctors`**

```json
{
  "id": "doc1",
  "name": "Dr. Rao",
  "slots": [
    { "id": "9-10", "startTime": "09:00", "endTime": "10:00", "maxCapacity": 2 },
    { "id": "10-11", "startTime": "10:00", "endTime": "11:00", "maxCapacity": 2 }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Book Token

**`POST /tokens/book`**

```json
{
  "patientId": "p1",
  "doctorId": "doc1",
  "source": "ONLINE"
}
```

### 3. Add Emergency Token

**`POST /tokens/emergency`**

```json
{
  "patientId": "p999",
  "doctorId": "doc1"
}
```

### 4. Cancel Token

**`POST /tokens/cancel`**

```json
{
  "tokenId": "token_3"
}
```

Automatically promotes the highest-priority waitlisted token.

### 5. View Doctor Schedule

**`GET /doctors/:id/schedule`**

Returns slot-wise confirmed and waitlisted tokens.

## Edge Cases Handled

- ✅ Slot capacity never exceeded (except controlled emergency overbooking)
- ✅ Priority-based displacement works correctly
- ✅ Cancellation frees slots and promotes waitlisted patients
- ✅ Emergency patients are always accommodated
- ✅ Unique token IDs prevent data corruption
- ✅ Multiple doctors and slots handled independently

---

## Assumptions and Trade-offs

### Assumptions

- All doctors work in fixed hourly slots
- Consultation time is uniform per patient
- Priority rules are globally agreed and static
- In-memory storage is acceptable for this scope

### Trade-offs

- ⚠️ No persistence across restarts
- ⚠️ No concurrency control (single-process assumption)
- ⚠️ No explicit no-show timer (can be added as an enhancement)

---

## How to Run the Project

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Server runs at: **http://localhost:3000**

### 3. Simulation (One OPD Day)

A standalone simulation script (`simulateDay.js`) demonstrates:

- Creation of multiple doctors and slots
- Booking tokens from all sources
- Priority-based displacement
- Cancellation and reallocation
- Emergency insertion

**Run the simulation:**

```bash
node simulateDay.js
```

The console output clearly shows how tokens move between:
- ✅ Confirmed list
- ⏳ Waitlist
- ❌ Cancellation
- 🚨 Emergency override

This simulation validates the correctness of the allocation logic.

---

## Conclusion

This OPD Token Allocation Engine demonstrates:

- ✅ Clear problem understanding
- ✅ Practical system design
- ✅ Correct handling of real-world constraints
- ✅ Clean, maintainable Node.js logic
